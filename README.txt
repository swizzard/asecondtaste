Code for the website menus.samraker.com / asecondtaste.net

This is the website front-end for "A Second Taste," a project created by my colleague Rachel Rakov and me for our Advanced Natural Language
Processing class in the Fall of 2012. The goal of the project was to use Machine Learning to classify dishes from the New York Public Library's
What's on the Menu Project (http://menus.nypl.org) by course. Rachel handled most of the ML, I built the site.

Unfortunately, I was very new to Django at the time, so I messed it up pretty bad. I've since gone back in the last month or so, armed with
a better understanding of Django and jQuery, and basically rebuilt the thing from the ground up. It works now.

I think I'm proudest of the form(set)-related jQuery stuff I did (etc/formstuff2.js).
